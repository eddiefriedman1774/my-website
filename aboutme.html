        <p>Currently, I teach English in Israel to 3rd to 6th graders where I have developed a sense of attachment and respect 
            for the culture and for the Hebrew language. In my free time, I am learning how to code to eventually work in
             bioinformatics. Pharmacology is another interest for me, so to learn more about this
              fascinating field, I am working towards my PTCE certification. I am an iPhone
               photographer who enjoys capturing nature and documenting fashion through
                social media. </p>
